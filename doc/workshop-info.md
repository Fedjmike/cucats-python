# CUCaTS Programming Workshops

The Cambridge University Computing and Technology Society (CUCaTS) is running a series of introductory programming workshops. The goal for the workshop will be to introduce participants to the absolute basics of programming with Python. No prior experience is expected - if you know what a keyboard is, you should be good. The workshop will be a fairly informal, undergrad guided two-hour instructional session which you can follow along with your laptop and ask us for guidance.
