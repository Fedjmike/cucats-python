# Word count challenge

You know about strings. You know that you can make a string using quotes. For example:
```
my_string = "Hello! Welcome to the word count challenge. :)"
```

Because strings are commonly used, Python has some built-in features for dealing with them.
Python knows how to split string objects up into parts.
In Python, string objects have a built-in _method_ called `split`.
(A _method_ is a function associated with an object.)

To use a method on an object, we write the object, then a dot, then the method, then a pair of brackets, `()`, like so:
```
my_string.split()
```
The brackets indicate that `split` is a function, rather than a variable, for instance. Functions always have brackets!


## Exercise 1

* Use IDLE, or the `print()` function, to see what `my_string.split()` is.

Hint: it should be a list of _somethings_.
